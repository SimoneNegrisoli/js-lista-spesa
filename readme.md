# Shopping list

## Description

### MILESTONE 1 - CREATION OF A SHOPPING LIST

- We ask (prompt) the user the products to buy and put them somewhere (where?)

- We continue to ask for products until the user enters "stop"

### MILESTONE 2 - PRINTING THE SHOPPING LIST
Given the previously created shopping list, print the items of the list individually on the page (even brutally, as long as they are visible).
